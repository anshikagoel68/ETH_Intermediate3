                                                       **PROJECT**
For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it for your walk-through video. From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

                                               **SHORT BRIEF ABOUT ERC20 TOKEN**

The term "ERC20 token" refers to a specific type of token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 stands for Ethereum Request for Comment 20, and it defines a set of rules and functions that an Ethereum token contract must implement to be considered ERC20 compliant. 

**Characteristics of ERC20 Tokens:**
1) Fundamental Functions:
              a) balanceOf(address): Returns the token balance of a specified address.
              b) transfer(address, uint256): Transfers tokens from the caller's address to the specified address.
              c) allowance(address owner, address spender): Returns the remaining number of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the owner.
              d) approve(address spender, uint256 amount): Sets the spender's allowance for the caller's tokens.
              e) transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount): Transfers tokens from one address to another using the allowance mechanism.
2) Events: Events such as Transfer and Approval are emitted during state changes, providing a way for external applications to react to contract state changes.
3) Optional Functions: Tokens can implement additional optional functions, such as totalSupply(), name(), and symbol() to provide metadata about the token.
4) Standard Interface: ERC20 defines a standard interface that allows tokens to be easily integrated with wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts.


                                                          ABOUT CONTRACT

**Contract Name:** Token, which inherits from ERC20. This means Token contract inherits all the functionalities of the ERC20 token standard.
**License:** This contract is licensed under the MIT License.
**Compliation Version:** This contract is compile with Solidity version ^0.8.0 and deployed using  Remix IDE.

**Import:**
The import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"; statement in Solidity smart contracts serves a crucial role by integrating a standardized implementation of the ERC20 token standard from the OpenZeppelin Contracts repository. This allows the contract to inherit and utilize pre-defined functionalities essential for ERC20 tokens, including transferring tokens, managing allowances, querying balances, and emitting standard events like Transfer and Approval. Importing from OpenZeppelin Contracts ensures reliability and security, as their code undergoes rigorous testing and auditing processes. It promotes code reuse, saves development time, and aligns with best practices in smart contract development. However, it necessitates caution regarding version control and dependency management, ensuring that the imported contract version aligns with the intended use and security requirements of the deploying contract.

**Description:** This Solidity smart contract implements an ERC20 token using OpenZeppelin's ERC20 standard, with additional functionalities for minting initial supply, minting new tokens, and burning tokens.

**Contract Details:-**
(a) Declares a public state variable owner of type address to store the address of the contract deployer 
(b) Inherited state variable totalSupply of unsigned integer type to dynamically tracks the total supply of tokens issued (increases with minting and decreases with burning).

**Features:-**
1) Constructor
~It initializes the ERC20 token with the name "ERC2O Token" and symbol "OCET".
~It sets the deployer's address (msg.sender) as the owner.

2) mintInitialSupply function
~It allows the owner to mint the initial supply of tokens.
~It checks msg.sender must be the owner.
~Ensures that the total supply of tokens is zero before minting (to prevent multiple initial minting).
~Calls _mint function inherited from ERC20 to mint initialSupply tokens and assigns them to the owner..

3) mint function
~ It allows the owner to mint additional tokens to a specified account.
~ It checks msg.sender must be the owner.
~ Calls _mint function inherited from ERC20 to mint amount tokens and assigns them to accountEnables users to transfer tokens to another account.

4) burn function
~ It allows the owner to burn tokens from a specified account.
~ It checks msg.sender must be the owner.
~ Calls _burn function inherited from ERC20 to burn amount tokens from account.
